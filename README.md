# AutomynLabs

🚀 Automating intelligence — one workflow at a time.

**AutomynLabs** is a creative lab focused on building and exploring automated workflows powered by AI, low-code/no-code tools, and custom automation frameworks.

## 🌐 What We Do

We design and prototype intelligent, scalable automation systems using platforms like:

- [n8n](https://n8n.io) — open-source automation workflows
- [Make](https://www.make.com) — visual no-code automation
- AI Agents & APIs — OpenAI, LangChain, and more
- Custom Python-based automation flows
- Integration with tools like Slack, Notion, Google Workspace, and APIs

## 🧠 Vision

To simplify complex processes by combining artificial intelligence with intuitive automation — unlocking powerful workflows for developers, teams, and creators.

## 🔧 Projects in Progress

- `auto-content-publisher` — Automatically generate & publish AI-powered content across platforms
- `n8n-ai-ops` — Extend n8n with generative AI nodes and decision logic
- `agent-pipeline` — Custom orchestration for AI agents (LLMs + tools)

More coming soon…
